Django Database Backup
======================

This Django application provides management commands to help backup and
restore your project database to AmazonS3, Dropbox or Local Disk.

-  Keep your important data secure and offsite.
-  Use Crontab or Celery to setup automated backups.
-  Great to keep your development database up to date.

Management Commands
-------------------

dbbackup
~~~~~~~~
Backup your database to the specified storage. By default this
will backup all databases specified in your settings.py file and will not
delete any old backups. You can optionally specify a server name to be included
in the backup filename.

::

    dbbackup [-s <servername>] [-d <database>] [--clean] [--compress] [--encrypt] [--backup-extension <file-extension>]

dbrestore
~~~~~~~~~

Restore your database from the specified storage. By default
this will lookup the latest backup and restore from that. You may optionally
specify a servername if you you want to backup a database image that was
created from a different server. You may also specify an explicit local file to
backup from.

::

    dbrestore [-d <database>] [-s <servername>] [-f <localfile>] [--uncompress] [--backup-extension <file-extension>]

mediabackup
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Backup media files. Default this will backup the files in
the MEDIA_ROOT. Optionally you can set the DBBACKUP_MEDIA_PATH setting.

::

    mediabackup [--encrypt] [--clean] [--servername <servername>]

Examples
--------

If you run dbbackup out of the box, it will be able to create and restore from a
local file dump of your database as configured in your Django project's setup.

Here's how we create a simple dump of the database:

::

    $ python manage.py dbbackup
    
    Backing Up Database: /home/user/django-project/db.sqlite3
      Reading: /home/user/django-project/db.sqlite3
      Backup tempfile created: 38.0 KB
      Writing file to Filesystem: /home/user/django-project/, filename: default.backup


...and here's how we load that dump again (WARNING! Doing that of course overwrites the
entire existing database)

::

    $ python manage.py dbrestore 
    
    Restoring backup for database: /home/user/django-project/db.sqlite3
      Finding latest backup
      Restoring: /home/user/django-project/default.backup
      Restore tempfile created: 38.0 KB
    Are you sure you want to continue? [Y/n]y
      Writing: /home/user/django-project/db.sqlite3


Now, databases are not the only thing you should remember to backup. Your
``settings.MEDIA_ROOT`` is where user contributed uploads reside, and it
should also be backed up.

::

    $ python manage.py mediabackup
    
    Backing up media files
      Backup tempfile created: None (233.0 B)
      Writing file to Filesystem: /home/user/django-project/
